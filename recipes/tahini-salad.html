    <div>
        <p>Fresh, colorful, and full of texture, this mixed vegetable tahini salad
            is a perfect way to turn simple ingredients into something vibrant and
            satisfying. Crisp vegetables provide plenty of crunch, while the creamy
            tahini dressing ties everything together with nutty depth and a hint of tang.
            It’s hearty enough to stand on its own as a light meal, but also makes a refreshing
            side that pairs well with grilled meats, grains, or warm flatbreads.</p>
        
        <p>The beauty of this salad is its versatility—you can use whatever vegetables
            you have on hand and let the dressing do the heavy lifting. The tahini adds
            richness, lemon juice brightens it up, and a touch of garlic gives it that
            extra kick. Once tossed together, every bite balances freshness with creaminess,
            making it one of those dishes you’ll keep coming back to.</p>
