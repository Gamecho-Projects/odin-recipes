        <p class="recipe-background">Few dishes capture the heart of Spanish home cooking like the tortilla de patatas.
         This simple yet satisfying omelette of potatoes and eggs is a staple in kitchens across
        Spain, beloved for its versatility and comforting flavors. Served warm or at room temperature,
         it makes an ideal tapas dish, picnic snack, or even a quick dinner paired with a fresh salad.</p>
    
         <p class="recipe-background">Its beauty lies in its balance. The soft golden potatoes, rich eggs, sweet onions and of course a bit too much olive oil.
        Every region (and household) in Spain has its own take, but the essence
        remains the same: humble ingredients transformed into something greater than the sum of their parts.</p>
