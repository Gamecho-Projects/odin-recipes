   <p>Few dishes capture the heart of Spanish home cooking like the tortilla de patatas.
    This simple yet satisfying omelette of potatoes and eggs is a staple in kitchens across
    Spain, beloved for its versatility and comforting flavors. Served warm or at room temperature,
    it makes an ideal tapas dish, picnic snack, or even a quick dinner paired with a fresh salad.</p>
    
    <p>Its beauty lies in its balance. The soft golden potatoes, rich eggs, sweet onions and of course a bit too much olive oil.
        Every region (and household) in Spain has its own take, but the essence
        remains the same: humble ingredients transformed into something greater than the sum of their parts.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>


    <ul>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>500g potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3 medium onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>400ml olive oil (can be reused don't worry it isn't all going in your belly)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large nonstick frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until translucent.</li>
        <li>Into the same pan add the potatoes and cook until fork tender (lower heat if they begin to crisp)</li>
        <li>Using a slotted spoon take out the potatoes and eggs and put into a large bowl (reserve the rest of the oil in the fridge and re use for 1-2 weeks)</li>
        <li>Crack your eggs into the bowl with your potatoes and onions season with some salt to taste. Mix but do not whisk you do not want to incorporate too much air. Let is sit for 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Heat a generous amount of olive oil into the frying pan over medium heat. Pour in the egg and potato mixture, spreading it evenly. Cook for 5â€“6 minutes until the bottom is golden and the top is just set.</li>
        <li>Place a large plate over the pan, flip the tortilla onto the plate, then slide it back into the pan. Cook the other side until just firm with a little bit of give in the very middle</li>
        <li>Take your tortilla out and wrap it in foil.</li>
        <li>Let it rest for 10 minutes then enjoy hot or cold</li>
    </ol>
