I thought that this went really well. I'm excited to get going with CSS. It took me a couple of days on and off but realistically I'm confident I could have done it in a few hours if I wasn't going off on tangents and getting myself distracted. It also took me a bit longer than I'd have hoped to properly do the attributions but I'm happy with how they went.

I believe that I have done all of the things required in this project and I'm relatively confident that all of the syntax is correct. I've really enjoyed this and I'm glad I've started.
